# Deep Reinforcement Learning for Optimal Control

This repository contains files for my research into applying deep reinforcement learning for optimal control problems. The [Intertemporal Portfolio Choice Problem](https://github.com/pwilczewski/optimal_control_RL/blob/main/IntertemporalPortfolioChoiceProblem.ipynb) notebook contains my analysis of the Merton Portfolio Problem using Deep Reinforcement Learning. The conda environment I used for this analysis is included in stable_baselines3_env.yaml, the gym environment for this analysis is located in PortfolioChoice.py and the estimated model parameters are saved in PortfolioChoice_solution.zip.
